"""
The ComGuard conversational agent.

Two entry points, both taking the same arguments:

    get_response(...)         -> str              for written replies
    get_response_stream(...)  -> AsyncGenerator   for spoken replies

Streaming exists for voice specifically: app.py starts synthesising each
sentence as soon as it is complete, so the audio is ready almost as soon as the
text is. On a slow connection in an emergency that difference is the difference
between a useful reply and an abandoned one.

The agent runs a deliberate two-step loop rather than letting the framework
iterate: one call that may request a tool, then one final call with the tool
result and tools removed. It cannot loop, cannot call a tool twice, and cannot
stall — the worst case is one wasted call. For a service somebody is waiting on
in the rain, a bounded wrong answer beats an unbounded right one.
